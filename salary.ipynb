    "1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric calculates the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better model fit.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. R-squared (R2): R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Mean Percentage Error (MPE): MPE calculates the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of relative error.\n",

    "5. Location: The geographical location of a job can have a significant impact on salary levels due to differences in cost of living and market demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Industry: The industry in which a job is located can also influence salary levels, as different industries may have different salary norms and market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
